I have used google Colab to do this assignment.
I have outputted 2 videos, one of the object detection using faster rcnn, with some simple prediction of ball, the other one is the output of the implementation of deepsort algorithm. 
The summary and the architechture diagram are inlcuded in the notebook itself.
